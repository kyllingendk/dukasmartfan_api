# Introduction

This is a Python module for making a connection to a Duka One S6W/DUKA One S6 Plus Wi-Fi.

Forked from and heavily inspired by the great [dingusdk dukaonesdk package](https://github.com/dingusdk/dukaonesdk) 

The primary goal for this module is to make an interface from Home Assistant to Duka One

The module implements:

* On/Off 
* Set/Get speed
* Set/Get Mode
* Start/Stop Schedulemode
* Notification when a state changes. 
 
## Example

See the examples.py file

Have a look at http://www.dingus.dk/ for the original implementation.

## Other compatible devices

There are several one "bands" of the duka one ventilator.
* Blauberg Vento
* Siku With several models.
